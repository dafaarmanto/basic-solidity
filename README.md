# Basic Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

This repository cover topics such as:

- Data Types
- Functions
- Array & Structs
- Store Locations (Memory, calldata, and storage)



## Remix IDE

Remix IDE allows developing, deploying and administering smart contracts for Ethereum like blockchains. It can also be used as a learning platform.

Remix IDE are required for compiling and deploying solidity smart contracts

## Code Examples

```javascript

pragma solidity 0.8.8; // Solidity Version.

contract YourContractName {
    // Write Here
}
```


## Project Structure

Always put .sol file inside contracts folder!

After you write your smart contract, simply press `CTRL + S` to compile the file

After that go to to the Deploy & Run Transaction menu
